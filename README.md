*Welcome to my Repo. I built two apps for the ongoing Fintech competition, 
both apps are scalable and useful in our financial institutions. The First 
app is the Loan repayment Calculator app and the second app is an app that 
helps to detect Fraud committed by  loan applicants. *

*According to investopedia, Amortization is an accounting technique used to 
periodically lower the book value of a loan or intangible asset over a set 
period of time. In relation to a loan, amortization focuses on spreading 
out loan payments over time. When applied to an asset, amortization is 
similar to depreciation

#                               Fraud Detection using Auto AI*

In the course of loan application, some criminals may want to commit fraud 
with the use of their credit card. With my application, such fraud that 
will be committed by such  criminals will be  prevented and detected. My application makes use of  Auto AI ( Automation and 
Artificial intelligence) to analyse any transactions by the loan applicant 
through the dataset inherent in my  application and any fraud that'll will be commited  will be detected based on two important conditions. My Web app will 
calculate two numeric values,which are 0 or 1 depending on whether there is a 
fraudulent transactions or not. 

 Condition 1 :If the calculated value by the Web app is 0,then this means that 
the loan applicant is about to commit fraud, such fraudulent step will 
therefore be nipped in the bud and the loan application is not approved . 
#Condition 2:if the calculated value is 1,that means the loan applicant is not 
criminally minded, and therefore the loan will be granted to the loan 
applicant
